it's become a reliable tool to practice in the language C++.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 11, part 2

I was gravitated towards the likeness of the lab because of the skills that it instilled in me. Enabling me to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts while giving me the much-needed hands-on experience with practical problem-solving. Working towards a predetermined output required a large assortment of knowledge to fulfill it. Such as a program to generate and select a secret number. Forced me to think carefully about my inputs. Implementing a cautious mind towards the desired structure of the lab. The lab had provided me with practice on my faults. Granting me an opportunity to continue to learn, despite such depth into the matter. Ultimately, reinforcing my understanding of both the C++ formatting as well as the specific outcomes from multiple iterations.

Lab 7, part 1

The reasons behind my choice of the seventh lab were a result of its complexity. The implementation of the 24-hour clock was completely new to me. I've always been aware of its concept. However, putting it into practice was shown to be difficult. The struggles within the lab began once my partner and I had to create a system involving city street parking rules. I was unfamiliar with the logic needed to distinguish between streets and the time zones that allow parking for said streets. As a result, I had to enhance my ability to apply newly acquired knowledge towards a structured program. Maintaining a balance of coherence and application towards the real-world scenario. The lab had not only encouraged me to think critically. Also led me to be creative. The expected output was achievable through a multitude of ways. Allowing the experiments of the language to further my comprehension of the syntax alongside the C++ formatting.

Lab 3, part 1

During this lab, my interests revolved around the amount of knowledge I would acquire. Due to my being extremely unaware of the multiple methods for achieving the fixed output. Such ignorance had stunted my progress towards truly understanding the tasks and reasoning of code. Consequently, my ability to connect one's idea to the syntax needed to achieve such a result had anchored my growth. Nevertheless, I had to persevere and apply the formulas required for the Basal Metabolic Rate. I then began to see the gap of uncertainty closing. While also Personalizing results, tailored towards any input. Establishing principles to support me in improving my confidence in managing conditional logic and function organization. Through such experiences, I'd continue the pursuit of the language and amass insight towards effectively coding within C++.
